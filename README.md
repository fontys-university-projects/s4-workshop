# Martin Workshop

*I might just kill 3 birds with one stone creating PWA + Android + IOS by using https://ionicframework.com/ or https://tailwindcss.com/ (or both) + https://capacitorjs.com/ because Javascript is better than JAVA :3*

>Since the different workshops have different requirements, there will be separate folders, which will respect each workshop's requirement

*There will be also a todo list, which will be updated each time with the tasks*

 ## PWA todo list 
- [x] Offline page
## IOS todo list
- [ ] Get a Mac (yeah.. F@#k Apple)
## Android todo list

I will update the list when I find the document again haha, feel free to comment the todo ðŸ˜…
